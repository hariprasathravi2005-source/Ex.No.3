## NAME: Hariprasath.R
## REGISTER NUMBER: 212223060081
## PROMPT: 
Prepare a detailed scenario-based report on Experiment 3: Scenario-Based Report Development 
Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques for designing an AI-powered customer support chatbot. The 
chatbot should handle product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The report 
must compare how different Generative AI platforms, specifically ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta 
AI, respond when applying Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, Preceding Question 
Prompting, and Missing Word Prompting. The discussion should highlight differences in response 
style, clarity, depth, accuracy, and user-friendliness. The content should be presented in a 
professional academic report format, covering aim, explanation, methodology, comparative findings, 
evaluation, conclusion, and result.

## Aim  

To design prompts using Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, Preceding Question Prompting, and Missing Word Prompting for building an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries.  
To evaluate responses from ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Meta AI and identify which performs best.  

---

## Explanation  

Prompt engineering influences how AI models generate responses. Different AI systems show varied behavior in terms of clarity, depth, empathy, and structure.  
We test four prompt types with three AIs (**ChatGPT, Gemini, Meta AI**) in a **customer support chatbot scenario**.  

---

## Procedure & Responses  

### 1. Straightforward Prompts  
**Prompt:** *‚ÄúList three steps to reset my Wi-Fi router.‚Äù*  

| AI System   | Response Style |
|-------------|----------------|
| ChatGPT     | Clear 3-step instructions, simple and direct. |
| Gemini      | Gives steps + extra security advice (e.g., change password after reset). |
| Meta AI     | Provides short instructions, but less detail than ChatGPT/Gemini. |

---

### 2. Tabular Format Prompting  
**Prompt:** *‚ÄúProvide a table comparing common product issues, their causes, and quick fixes.‚Äù*  

| AI System   | Response Style |
|-------------|----------------|
| ChatGPT     | Well-structured, clean table with 3 columns (Issue, Cause, Fix). |
| Gemini      | Larger table with extra technical info (sometimes too detailed). |
| Meta AI     | Simple table, fewer entries, more concise but not very detailed. |

---

### 3. Preceding Question Prompting  
**Prompt 1:** *‚ÄúWhy is my smartphone battery draining quickly?‚Äù*  
**Prompt 2:** *‚ÄúBased on these causes, what steps can I take to improve battery life?‚Äù*  

| AI System   | Response Style |
|-------------|----------------|
| ChatGPT     | Explains causes (apps, brightness, background activity) ‚Üí suggests fixes clearly. |
| Gemini      | Gives detailed technical explanations (CPU cycles, app permissions) ‚Üí advanced fixes. |
| Meta AI     | Shorter explanation, practical fixes, but less depth compared to ChatGPT/Gemini. |

---

### 4. Missing Word Prompting  
**Prompt:** *‚ÄúTo track an order, you need your ____.‚Äù*  

| AI System   | Response Style |
|-------------|----------------|
| ChatGPT     | ‚ÄúTracking ID‚Äù (direct and correct). |
| Gemini      | ‚ÄúTracking number (also called tracking ID).‚Äù |
| Meta AI     | ‚ÄúOrder number‚Äù (sometimes ambiguous compared to tracking ID). |

---

## Evaluation  

- **ChatGPT** ‚Üí Best balance of clarity, detail, and conversational tone. Handles all four prompt types smoothly.  
- **Gemini** ‚Üí Very detailed and technical, good for advanced users, but may overwhelm normal customers.  
- **Meta AI** ‚Üí Simple and concise, but often lacks depth and detail compared to ChatGPT/Gemini.  

---

## Conclusion  

For designing a customer support chatbot, **ChatGPT is the most effective** because it balances clarity, helpfulness, and user-friendly tone.  

- Gemini is better suited for **technical/expert audiences** who want detailed explanations.  
- Meta AI works well for **quick and short replies**, but may not be enough for troubleshooting complex issues.  

üëâ **Final Choice:** ChatGPT is the best overall for customer support chatbot development.  

---

## Result  

Thus, the prompts were executed successfully, and the comparison showed that **ChatGPT is the most suitable AI system** for building an effective, user-friendly customer support chatbot.
